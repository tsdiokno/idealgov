My personal checklist for the kind of government I'd like to have for the Philippines. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

## Intro

I'm listing down all prescriptions on public governance that I have. I should hopefully be able to use it to set my filters in voting for the Philippine elections.

These only reflect my personal political views.

### State Capitalism

The Philippines already owns highly-patronized [GOCCs (Government-Controlled and Owned Corporations)](http://ogcc.gov.ph/gocc/) such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) and Duty Free.

The Government should take advantage of this provision to create more government-owned companies that will generate more revenue for the nation.

#### We Shouldn't Live on Taxes Alone

GOCCS could relax the need for the Government to impose heavier taxes on private enterprises and individuals to increase national revenue.

#### Government Malls? I'll Take It!

The proof-of-concept exists. CCP is the premiere classical theater destination within the Metro Manila which functions as the regular venue for high-profile concerts and the renowned Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival.

Duty Free offers premium consumer goods in different categories. If the Government can run an in-airport department store franchise, it should be able to establish a company of the same likeness opened for the rest of the country.

#### A More Lively Market Competition

Government-owned companies can provide better salary rates if not more jobs to unemployed citizens. It can further its own inclination for welfare by setting smaller profit margins on goods to make it more available to more people.

It can compete against products, services, and goods in the market owned by private entities which should in turn promote a more lively economy.

### Bail Enforcement Enhancement

Or bounty hunting. The national police if not currently compromised is under-numbered or under-equipped to track down an urgently increasing volume of criminals or violatiors.

The Government will do well in discouraging citizens from patronizing criminals or being generally apathetic towards them when caught on sight. A compelling commission in exchange for turning over fugitives or criminals will give signed citizen bounty hunters to take part in law-enforcement and the financial incentive that goes along with it under an enhanced bounty hunting program.

#### Policing the Police

This also allows the policing power to be decentralized given that there is no perfect agency. This proposal may empower the wider citizenry in actively holding powers to account alongside watchdogs such as the Commission on Human Rights.
